# Shark-fisheries-analysis
work flows for for analysing shark catch and socio economic pattern in pelagic fisheries in Kochi, India.
This repository contains R scripts and example datasets demonstrating analytical workflows used to study shark fisheries based on landing data collected during my tenure as a Project Assistant.
The included data are mock, randomized, and anonymized subsets created solely to showcase R programming, data visualization, and analysis skills.

 **Overview**

The analysis focuses on:

Summarizing and visualizing shark landing data.

Exploring species composition, catch trends, and econometric analysis of pelagic fishery.

Performing exploratory and statistical analyses on fisheries datasets.

Demonstrating use of R for data analysis and visualisation.

**About the Data**

The dataset included here is not real field data.

It is generated by randomizing and adding noise to genuine observations collected by me during project work.

The purpose is to demonstrate programming and analytical capability without disclosing sensitive or unpublished data.
